# Manage EMR on EKS with Terraform

[Manage EMR on EKS with Terraform](https://cevo.com.au/post/manage-emr-on-eks-with-terraform/)

- [Amazon EMR on EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/eks/) is a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to automate the provisioning and management of open-source big data frameworks on EKS. While [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/) is popular for working with [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) clusters, it has limitations when it comes to building infrastructure that integrates multiple AWS services. Also it is not straightforward to update EKS cluster resources incrementally with it. On the other hand [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) can be an effective tool for managing infrastructure that includes not only EKS and EMR virtual clusters but also other AWS resources. Moreover Terraform has a wide range of [modules](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules) and it can even be simpler to build and manage infrastructure using those compared to the CLI tool. In this post, weâ€™ll discuss how to provision and manage Spark jobs on EMR on EKS with Terraform. [Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform](https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/v4.7.0/) will be used for provisioning EKS, EMR virtual cluster and related resources. Also Spark job autoscaling will be managed by [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) where two Spark jobs with and without [Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#dynamic-resource-allocation) will be compared.
